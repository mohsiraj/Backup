Install Jenkins on the Master Node
wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | apt-key add -
 
echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
 
apt-get update
 
apt-get install jenkins
Note: 
There is a bug in the latest Jenkins which is 2.95. (Dec 15th, 2017)

If apt-get install jenkins failed to install and start Jenkins for you, try to install a previous version of jenkins by running apt-get install jenkins=2.67

Trouble Shooting
If you don't see the "Launch agent via execution of command on master" option in the add slave page. This is due to the fact that the latest version of Jenkins has removed that option from the default install and moved it to this plugin: https://plugins.jenkins.io/command-launcher

The solution is to install the command-launcher Jenkins plugin first before you can add a slave.

Install Jenkins Agent on the Slave Node
running on master node:

sudo -iu jenkins
 
ssh root@<slave_ip> mkdir -p .ssh
 
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@<slave_ip> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
 
running on slave node:

mkdir ~/bin
 
cd bin
 
wget http://<master_ip>:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar
 
sudo apt-get install default-jre 
start slave agent: 

ssh root@<slave_ip> java -jar /root/bin/slave.jar
