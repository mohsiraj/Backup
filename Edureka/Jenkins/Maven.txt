Maven Project type
In this lecture you might NOT see the Maven Project  type available to choose from when you click the New Item  button.

In order to have the Maven Project  type, you will need to install the Maven Project Plugin.

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Maven+Project+Plugin If you are building a complicated maven project, definitely pick the maven project type here, this is a project template that Jenkins has reserved specifically for Maven-based projects.

Jenkins understands the pom dot XML file format and would take advantage of it which can greatly reduce the manual configuration.

But considering our maven project is a very simple one and the free style project would suffice, so here we just  go with the free style project.
